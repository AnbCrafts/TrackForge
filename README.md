Got it 👍 You want a **README.md** for your **TrackForge** project.
Since TrackForge is a **bug tracking and project management system** (with role-based ticketing, team collaboration, and analytics dashboard), I’ll draft a professional, structured README in Markdown.

Here’s a solid starting point:
